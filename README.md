# Skin-Cancer-Detection-using-CNN
This project describes an efficient and robust method for diagnosing skin cancer. Identification of lesions and tumours is a difficult task in medical science due to 
the complex nature of the data. Inspiration has been taken from various research that has happened in Skin Cancer Diagnosis. Hence a deep learning based convolution 
neural network is used to build a computer model for predicting new cases of skin cancer after doing data preprocessing. The  were conducted using a public dataset 
which is collected from the Kaggle archive i.e. HAM10000. The final dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which can serve as a training set for academic 
machine learning purposes. The dataset was applied to the proposed model for diagnosing various types of skin cancers using convolutional neural networks
